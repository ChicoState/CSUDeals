instructions/commands for ionic unit testing

**Please take note of  any errors as the installation goes, some of these 
commands need to sudo privileges to install properly

1.)Change your working directory to our project files(the ionic project file itself)

   cd CSUDDeals/CSUDeals


2.)Will need to install jasmine-core and bower to work, so run below command

    npm install jasmine-core
    npm install -g bower

3.) next run the below command to install karma an its dependencies

    npm install karma karma-jasmine karma-phantomjs-launcher --save-dev
    npm install -g karma-cli
    npm install

4.) when asked for what version of angular you want to install,
choose 3 by typing !3 when prompted

    bower install angular-mocks --save-dev

5.)To test whether it worked, type in the command:

    karma start tests/my.conf.js

6.) That should do it, I have already set up the karma files following the tutorial. To see how to write your own tests, see this tutorial and others:
